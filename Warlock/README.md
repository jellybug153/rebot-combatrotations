# Warlock Rotation

## Settings
- General: Disable OutOfCombat for FishBot
If this setting is enabled all OutOfCombat Rotations are disabled for the FishBot.
Beware: The bot will not keep any buff or pet active while using FishBot!

- General: Automatic mana-management through Life Tap
(Demonology and Affliction only)
The Bot will use Life Tap to regain mana through life sacrifical.
It will use Life Tap if the player got more than 65% Health and the Mana drops below 16% of the Players MHealth.
So it will keep (in theory) the mana at 100% because 16% of Life is the base regain of Mana through LifeTap.

- Survival: Soulstone yourself if not in group
Will use Soulstone on yourself in the OutOfCombat Rotation.

- Pet: Selected Pet
Defines the Pet which will always be summoned if the bot decides that he needs to summon your pet.
It will summon the pet when it dies, or if you got the Grimorie of Sacrifice when the Buff weared off.

- Pet: Use Pet
If this is option is not set, then the bot won't summon a pet as companion.
It will however summon it to sacrifice it if you got the Grimorie of Sacrifice.

- Pet: HealthFunnel Pet HP in %
(Demonology and Affliction only)
This defines the Health of the Pet in % at which the bot will start using Health Funnel to heal it.
It will NOT do any other Combat Rotation as long as your Pet is below this value, because it is first priority!

- Pet: HealthFunnel Player HP in %
(Demonology and Affliction only)
This defines the Health of the Player in % which will get used,
to determine how long the Pet should be healed through Health Funnel.

- DPS: Use Terrorguard/Infernal automatically
This will disable the automatically usage of the Terrorguard/Infernal.

Doomguard/Terrorguard:
If the Target is an Elite Mob and it has more MaxHealth than the Player
it will Summon the demon, but only if the Targets current Health
is below 25% or the Players Health is below 50%

Infernal/Abyssal:
If the Target is an Elite Mob and it has more MaxHealth than the Player and if there are at least 3 adds
it will Summon the demon, but only if the Targets current Health
is below 25% or the Players Health is below 50%

- DPS: Use Dark Soul automatically
If the Target is an Elite Mob and it has more MaxHealth than the Player it will cast Dark Soul.

- CC: Use Shadowfury as Interrupt
If it should not be used as Interrupt cast it will be used to stun all enemies if there are more than 3 adds.
If Shadofury should get used as interrupt spell it will be used to stun the first interruptable spell it finds.

Use Single-Target Fear on PvP Targets.
The Targets will be banned from being feared again for the configured "Fear Ban Time"
